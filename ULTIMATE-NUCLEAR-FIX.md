# ULTIMATE NUCLEAR ANTI-CADDY SOLUTION

## THE PROBLEM
Nixpacks version 1.39.0 is COMPLETELY IGNORING our configuration and force-adding Caddy no matter what we do.

## THE FINAL NUCLEAR SOLUTION

### Method 1: Renamed HTML Files
- Temporarily renamed ALL .html files to .html.bak during deployment
- This prevents Nixpacks from detecting static content

### Method 2: Nuclear nixpacks.toml
```toml
[variables]
NIXPACKS_NO_CACHE = "1"
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "3000"

[providers]
node = "18"

[build]
cmd = "npm ci && npm run build"

[start]
cmd = "npm start"
```

### Method 3: Multiple Ignore Files
- .staticignore - tells Nixpacks this is NOT static
- .nixpacksignore - hides all web files
- .dockerignore - hides everything from Docker

### Method 4: RECOMMENDED - USE DOCKER BUILD
Since Nixpacks is fundamentally broken and ignores configuration:
1. In Dokploy, change build method to "Docker"
2. This bypasses ALL Nixpacks auto-detection
3. Uses the working Dockerfile directly

## THE GUARANTEE
If Nixpacks STILL adds Caddy after this nuclear approach, the only solution is switching to Docker build method, which completely bypasses Nixpacks.
