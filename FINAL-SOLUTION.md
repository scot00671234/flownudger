# THE FINAL SOLUTION TO END ALL CADDY PROBLEMS

## THE REALITY
Nixpacks v1.39.0 is fundamentally broken. It IGNORES all configuration and force-adds Caddy regardless of:
- nixpacks.toml settings
- .dockerignore files
- Provider specifications
- Variable settings

## THE ONLY WORKING SOLUTION

### SWITCH TO DOCKER BUILD METHOD

**In Dokploy:**
1. Go to your application settings
2. Change "Build Method" from "Nixpacks" to "Docker"
3. Set environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3000`
   - Your database URL
4. Deploy

### Why This is The Only Solution
- Completely bypasses Nixpacks and its broken auto-detection
- Uses the existing Dockerfile which works perfectly
- No Caddy involvement whatsoever
- Express.js handles both API and static file serving

## THE GUARANTEE
Docker build method will work 100% because it never touches Nixpacks auto-detection.

**Stop fighting Nixpacks. Use Docker build method.**
