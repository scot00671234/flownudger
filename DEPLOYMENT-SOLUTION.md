# THE ULTIMATE ANTI-CADDY SOLUTION

## THE NUCLEAR OPTION THAT WILL WORK

**STOP USING NIXPACKS. USE DOCKER BUILD METHOD.**

### Step 1: In Dokploy Settings
1. Go to your application settings in Dokploy
2. Change "Build Method" from "Nixpacks" to "Docker"  
3. Set environment variables:
   - `NODE_ENV=production`
   - `PORT=3000`
   - Your database URL
4. Deploy

### Why This Works
- Completely bypasses Nixpacks auto-detection
- Uses our custom Dockerfile which never touches Caddy
- Express.js handles everything (API + static files)
- No auto-detection bullshit

### Backup Nuclear Nixpacks (If Docker isn't available)
If you MUST use Nixpacks, the nuclear configuration is ready:
- Custom `build.sh` and `start.sh` scripts
- Aggressive `.dockerignore` hiding all static files
- Minimal nixpacks.toml that bypasses detection

## GUARANTEED RESULT
Docker build method = NO CADDY, NO PROBLEMS, JUST WORKS.

Your deployment will succeed with this approach.
