# Setup Instructions for GitHub Repository

Since git operations are restricted in the Replit environment, you'll need to push the code to GitHub manually. Here are the steps:

## Method 1: Download and Upload to GitHub

1. **Download the project**
   - In Replit, go to the file explorer
   - Click the three dots menu (â‹®) 
   - Select "Download as zip"
   - Extract the zip file on your local machine

2. **Upload to GitHub**
   - Go to https://github.com/scot00671234/flownudger
   - Click "uploading an existing file"
   - Drag and drop all the extracted files
   - Write a commit message: "Initial commit - Flow waitlist application"
   - Click "Commit changes"

## Method 2: Clone and Push (if you have Git locally)

1. **Clone your empty repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/scot00671234/flownudger.git
   cd flownudger
   ```

2. **Copy files from this Replit**
   - Download the project as zip from Replit
   - Extract and copy all files to your local repository folder

3. **Add and commit**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Flow waitlist application"
   git push origin main
   ```

## Method 3: Use GitHub CLI (if installed)

1. **Initialize repository**
   ```bash
   gh repo clone scot00671234/flownudger
   cd flownudger
   ```

2. **Copy files and push**
   ```bash
   # Copy all files from Replit to this directory
   git add .
   git commit -m "Initial commit - Flow waitlist application"
   git push origin main
   ```
