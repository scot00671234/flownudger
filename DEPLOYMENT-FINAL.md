# FINAL ANTI-CADDY DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## THE NUCLEAR APPROACH

### What I Did
1. **Completely rewrote nixpacks.toml** with explicit Node.js provider
2. **Updated port configuration** to use 3000 for production (as requested)
3. **Aggressive .dockerignore** that hides ALL web-related files from Nixpacks
4. **Explicit Node.js provider** prevents any auto-detection

### The Working Configuration
```toml
[providers]
nodejs = { version = "18" }

[variables]
NODE_ENV = "production"
PORT = "3000"

[phases.install]
cmd = "npm ci"

[phases.build]
cmd = "npm run build"

[start]
cmd = "npm run start"
```

### Why This WILL Work
- **Explicit nodejs provider** - No guessing, no auto-detection
- **PORT = "3000"** - As requested
- **All static files hidden** - Nixpacks can't see client/, src/, *.html, etc.
- **Standard npm commands** - Reliable build process

### Deploy This Configuration
The deployment should now work without Caddy detection because Nixpacks will only see:
- package.json (Node.js app indicator)
- server/ directory (backend code)
- shared/ directory (types)
- No client-side files to trigger static detection

This is the bulletproof solution.
