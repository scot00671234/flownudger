# NUCLEAR DEPLOYMENT SOLUTION

## THE PROBLEM
Nixpacks auto-detects static files and forces Caddy NO MATTER WHAT configuration we use.

## THE NUCLEAR SOLUTION

### Option 1: Use Docker Build Method (RECOMMENDED)
1. In Dokploy, change build method from "Nixpacks" to "Docker"
2. Use the existing Dockerfile which bypasses all Nixpacks detection
3. Set environment variables: `NODE_ENV=production` and `PORT=3000`

### Option 2: Nuclear Nixpacks Override
If you MUST use Nixpacks:
1. The nuclear `nixpacks.toml` uses custom build scripts
2. All static files are hidden via aggressive `.dockerignore`  
3. Custom `build.sh` and `start.sh` scripts bypass detection

### Option 3: Manual Container Build
Build the Docker image manually:
```bash
docker build -t flow-app .
docker run -p 3000:3000 -e NODE_ENV=production -e PORT=3000 flow-app
```

## GUARANTEED WORKING SOLUTION
**Switch to Docker build method in Dokploy** - this completely bypasses Nixpacks and all its auto-detection bullshit.
